# Image_Segmentation

This work uses `VGG16` from scratch as a `encoder` and `FCN8` as `decoder` to build a image segmentation model. The diagram of the network shown as,

The dataset uses [dataset1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0d9ZiqAgFkiOHR1NTJhWVJMNEU/view?usp=sharing) prepared by [divamgupta](https://github.com/divamgupta/image-segmentation-keras).<br>
Here is the example outlook of the dataset:
